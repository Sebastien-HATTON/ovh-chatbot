Contains all the handlers to communicate with different platforms

## Overview

+ `messenger` --> Contains all the object and functions and adapter object to reply on Facebook Messenger
+ `slack` --> Contains functions and adapter object to send reply on Slack

### Add a new platform

+ Add new webhook/route for specific platform in `routes` and in his handler in `controllers`

+ When you call `bot.ask()` in the controller of your webhook this function return a generic structure that you must transform/adapt for your platform.

+ In fact you have to develop adapters of your platform like for *Facebook Messenger* for example in [messenger_adapters.js](messenger/messenger_adapters.js).

+ For at least, each generic type you have to create an adapter and use this one in your function `send(messageData)` (example in [messenger.js](messenger/messenger.js)) that takes a generic structure and transform it via an adapter and send it on the platform API.
